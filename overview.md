The Ruby core-library includes classes like String, Array, Numerics (Floats, Integers), Range, Regexp and modules/mixins so that you can create your own enumerable and number classes. In total there are about 300 methods at your disposal.

RubyJS is a full port of these classes, implemented on top of the JavaScript core library. The library is __100% JavaScript__ and runs in all browsers, no compilers or interpeters are involved. All classes stay in the `RubyJS` or `R` namespace and do not extend any of the built-in JavaScript objects.
