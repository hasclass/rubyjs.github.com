# Launching RubyJS (alpha)

I'm happy to finally publicly announce RubyJS (alpha). RubyJS grew out of my need to be more productive in JavaScript, while at the same time still mostly developing with Ruby. I wanted a pragmatic solution that makes switching from one language to another easy.

### A JavaScript implementation of the Ruby core-lib

RubyJS is a port of the Ruby core classes, like String, Array, Numerics, Time, etc to JavaScript. RubyJS provides wrappers around native JS primitives and objects. Methods behave exactly like their counterparts in Ruby.

### 100% JavaScript

It is a 100% JavaScript library similar to jQuery or underscorejs. No magic, compilers, virtual machines or interpreters involved. Simply include the ruby.min.js file and you are good to go. RubyJS plays well with others, it sits in its own namespace RubyJS (aliased by R). Use it as an utility belt, or in an object oriented way.

### Benefits for Rubyists and Teams



### Benefits for Javascript developers

RubyJS is not only a tool for Rubyists. See the benefits for JavaScript developers.


RubyJS alpha is just the start, expect an ecosystem with additional classes. On the roadmap is a custom build of CoffeeScript tailored to RubyJS development.

### Dual-license

RubyJS is dual-licensed under AGPL and a commercial license. This was by far the hardest decision so far. There is a tremendous amount of tedious and boring grunt work involved: porting specs, adapting documentation, optimizing and the uninspiring work that is porting code. Suffering from RSI for over a year taught me to properly value my onmouseover time. Charging a modest sum allows me to work on it full-time and gives me the right incentives to not neglect the boring parts and make it a success.
