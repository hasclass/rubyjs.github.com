You may not assign or transfer this License Agreement without Our prior written consent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any instance in which You transfer ownership of an Application on a work for hire basis, You may assign licenses for the total Designated Users that have used the Software to develop said Application under this License Agreement to another party (Assignee) provided (i) you provide written notice to Us prior to the effective date of such assignment; and (ii) there is a written agreement, wherein the Assignee accepts the terms of this License Agreement. Upon any such transfer, the Assignee may appoint new Designated Users.

You acknowledge that this License Agreement is complete and is the exclusive representation of our agreement. No oral or written information given by Us or on our behalf shall create a warranty or collateral contract, or in any way increase the scope of this License Agreement in any way, and You may not rely on any such oral or written information. No term or condition contained in any purchase order shall have any force or effect,

There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this License Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with Us and our licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Software and/or Modifications, as applicable, with any other software or hardware not delivered by Us to You under this License Agreement. Your rights under this License Agreement apply only to Software, Modifications, and/or Applications for which all Designated Users are duly licensed hereunder.

If any provision in this License Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, such provision shall be deemed omitted; the remainder of this License Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this License Agreement shall remain in effect.

This License Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each party.

This License Agreement is governed by the Swiss law and the jurisdiction of the Swiss courts, and all parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction Swiss courts and further agree to commence any litigation which may arise hereunder in the state or federal courts located in the judicial district of Zurich, Switzerland.
