        <h2>Commercial Software License</h2>
        <p>
          This is the appropriate option if you want to use RubyJS to develop commercial applications whose source code you want to keep proprietary.
          <a href="/license/LICENSE">Read the Commercial License</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Open Source License</h2>
        <p>
          The open source license allows you to create an open source application under a license compatible with the GNU AGPL license v3. Although the AGPLv3 has many terms, the most important is that you must provide the source code of your application to your users so they can be free to modify your application for their own needs. This also applies when you run RubyJS on the server, for example as part of nodejs.

          There are license exceptions planned for extensions, developer toolkits and frameworks based on RubyJS. Contact us for more information.
